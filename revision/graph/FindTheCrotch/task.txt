---> Find the crotch <---

A 'human graph' is an undirected graph with the following features:
- The head (a cycle)
- A torso (vertices connected in a line)
- Two arms (vertices connected in a line, both starting at the same torso vertex)
- Two legs (vertices connected in a line, both starting at the end of the torso)

For example, this is a human graph:

  1 ----- 2
  |       |
  |       |
  3 - 4 - 5
      |
      8
      |
  7 - 6 - 9
      |
      0
      |
      11
     / \
    13  12
   /     \
  14      10

The vertex labelling is arbitrary.

The following constraints apply:
- The head contains at least 3 vertices
- Both arms have the same length
- Both legs have the same length
- The head, arms and legs all connect to the torso at different vertices
  (i.e. the torso contains at least 3 vertices/2 edges)

The crotch vertex is where the legs connect to the torso - B in the example.

Your task is to complete the function findTheCrotch(Graph g), which takes a human
graph and returns the crotch vertex.
