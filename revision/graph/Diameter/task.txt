---> Diameter <---

The diameter of a graph is the number of edges in the longest shortest path between two vertices.

That is, diameter(G) =   max    {length of shortest path from v to w}. 
                      v, w âˆˆ G

For example, this graph has diameter 4 (the length of the path from 0 to 7):

 0 --- 1 --- 2 --- 3
 |     |     |     |
 4 --- 5 --- 6 --- 7

Note that there are longer paths from 0 to 7, but only the shortest is considered.

Complete the function `int diameter(Graph g)` that returns the diameter of G.
