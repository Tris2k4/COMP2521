Question 3

(a) Which of the given sequences (A, B, C or D) would be produced by a
    valid post-order traversal of the same tree? Explain your answer.

B will be the correct answer since from the pre-order traversal, we obtained a tree that has root node is 16, left and right child of 16 is 10 and 24 and all the leaf nodes are 2 8 14 20 33. Since post-order traverse in a direction of Left Right Node which means they will traverse through the leaf nodes then the parents and so on

(b)

Value in the root node: 36

Value in the left child (of the root): 32 

Value in the right child (of the root): 39

(c) Give the rotations that are performed (if any) as a result of
    inserting each value.

If we first insert 25 in to the AVL tree, then it will cause imbalanced at node 22 since the height of the left of 22 is 0 and the right is 2. Therefore, this will lead to a Right Right case, hence we will rotate left at 22 for once. Next we will insert 8 into the AVL tree, this will cause an imbalanced at the node 5 where height of 5 on the left is 1 and the right is 3. This will lead to a Right Left case and hence we will need to perform a right rotation on the node 13 and left rotation on the node 7
